# Temperature-indication-on-sensing
This project is a Temperature indicator on seven segment display using data from cloud.
It displays temperature detected when the vibration is sensed by vibration sensor on a seven segment display.
It also demonstrates the data to and fro communication between cloud and Soc system using arduino json.
Following tools and technologies are used in this project.
1. esp8266 module
2. c programming language
3. arduino Json
4. thingspeak cloud
5. REST apis
6. arduino ide.
7. vibration sensor
8. dht11 temperature sensor
9. seven segment display.
